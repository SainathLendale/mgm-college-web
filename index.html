            <p>Mahatma Gandhi Mission Trust was established on December 20, 1982, in Nanded, Maharashtra, with a
                futuristic vision <br>
                to provide qualitative education and health services in the underdeveloped Marathawada region. Since
                inception, the trust <br>
                has focused on providing healthcare services, school education, and higher education with dedication and
                commitment. <br>
                In the course of time, MGM extended its services to Aurangabad, Navi Mumbai, and Parbhani in
                Maharashtra, and Noida <br>
                in Uttar Pradesh. A chain of schools and colleges in the faculties of engineering, architecture,
                medical, nursing, <br>
                management, computer science and IT, biotechnology, bioinformatics, fine arts, and journalism stand
                testimony to the <br>
                endeavors of the trust. Mahatma Gandhi Mission has been instrumental in promoting classical dance and
                music for art <br>
                seekers. The Trust has also paid heed to the aspect of physical fitness by promoting sports activities
                and creating the <br>
                facilities for them. Services to society at the grass-roots level have been the basic vocation of the
                trust, along with <br>
                education. The Trust has been instrumental in providing prompt and efficient healthcare services to the
                economically <br>
                weaker section of a society. The Trust's hospitals and medical colleges underscore its commitment to
                human resource <br>
                development, social health, and welfare.</p>
